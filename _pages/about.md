I am a machine learning engineer at Stability AI. Previously, I worked at Graphcore, developing neural networks on new and experimental AI hardware.

I studied pure maths at Oxford, and took the scenic route to working in machine learning, via a PhD and postdoc in logic. My research covered models and representations in mathematics, with particular focus on model theory, a branch of mathematical logic. I'm interested in maths, machine learning, and the many ways people can use AI. I also want to use this blog to explore some of the philosophical implications of AI.
